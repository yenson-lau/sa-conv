# SA-Conv: A code study of the relationship between self-attention and convolution

Based on the paper ["On the Relationship between Self-Attention and Convolutional Layers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03584) by Jean-Baptiste Cordonnier, Andreas Loukas, and Martin Jaggi, and [its reproduction](https://wandb.ai/me17b084/Self-Attention-and-Convolutions-VIT/reports/-Re-On-the-relationship-between-self-attention-and-convolutional-layers--Vmlldzo1Nzg0MDM) by wandb.ai.

***Work in-progress!***

## To-do

* Finish going through the paper and devise a deconvolution experiment
